# Update Session History

You will update the session history with concise high level notes about what has been done since the last 
session history update. You will put a header with timestamp on your update. You will build on the previous session history found in the `/session.md` file.

Keeping your update short is key. This file is intended to help you remember the flow of edits within a short 
time frame of a few days.
